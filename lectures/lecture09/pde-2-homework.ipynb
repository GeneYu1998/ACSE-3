The simplest approach to applying Dirichlet BCs would be to replace the corresponding row of the matrix with a 1 on the diagonal, zero in all other row entries and set the Dirichlet BC value in the corresponding row of the RHS matrix. The problem with this approach is that it destroys the symmetry of the LHS matrix which we can exploit in solvers (and indeed which is a requirement for the use of certain solvers) - this is because we have edited the row, but can't similarly edit the corresponding column without messing up the discretisation for other nodes.\n",

    "Now while simple our Jacobi solver from the lecture actually performs quite well for our lid driven cavity case. Firstly, as considered above, as the solve is fully vectorised that means that each iteration is very efficient. Secondly, as we are solving this problem to steady state we need to do a lot of time step where things don't change much from one to the next. This is an advantage for the iterative solvers utilised within each time step: starting the Jacobi iteration using an initial guess from the previous time level means that we can minimise the number of iterations required to converge. Indeed for the lid-driven cavity we observe that while for early time levels we have to use a large number of iterations, for much of latter parts of the solve Jacobi only requires a single iteration to converge, this is because the pressure is not changing by very much between time levels.  For a fully time-dependent problem a simple solver like Jacobi is not viable, the ability to start from a reasonable initial guess (from the previous time level) and simply the overall size of the problem, points to an optimal solution being a matrix based iterative solver such a preconditioned CG.\n",
